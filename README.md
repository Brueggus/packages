#### Banished and rejected packages ðŸ“‘

This is a list of packages which we will reject for good reasons:

- **snapd**: I didn't know how to help my users with it since it breaks *A LOT*. 	I recommend using native packages or [FlatPak](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Flatpak) instead. Also [there are a lot of other reasons to not use Snaps](https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/ppyz0g/damn_you_ubuntu/hd7jg1p/).

- **lib32-x265**:	There is absolutely no use case in which a 32-bit application (Linux or Windows) would want to ENCODE HEVC. I recommend disabling x265 for the packages depending on it (usually `ffmpeg` or `gstreamer`).

- **gst-plugins-{ugly,bad} (and lib32)**: These need too frequent rebuilds which can't by dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency request however are welcome!

- **ffmpeg-{full,headless} (and lib32)**:  These need too frequent rebuilds which can't by dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency request however are welcome!

- **mpv-amd, ffmpeg-amd**: This is just MPV/FFMPEG without CUDA and NVENC to achieve shorter build times without actual end user benefit.

- **unreal-engine (and -git)**: Some mirrors don't have sufficient storage space.



#### Banned due to licensing issues ðŸ›‘

- **aseprite{-git}**: Redistribution is explicitly prohibited in its [FAQ](https://www.aseprite.org/faq/#can-i-redistribute-aseprite).

- **multimc-git**: This application is licensed under the Apache 2 license, which [prohibits distributing custom binaries](https://multimc.org/#Branding) as the one built by us.
